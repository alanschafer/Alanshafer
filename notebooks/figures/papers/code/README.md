# Alan Schäfer – Independent Researcher

Welcome to my academic and creative research repository. I’m **Alan Schäfer**, an independent researcher producing critical ideas, papers, and analyses grounded in peer-informed methods and real-world impact.

In addition to academic research, I create fictional works deeply informed by themes of **theology**, **psychology**, and **human identity**.
